        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <pre>Greetings,
            I'm Aashwin Garg, a passionate student on a quest to discover my niche within the dynamic realm of computer science.
            
            🎓 Currently enrolled in Chitkara University, I am embracing the versatility of computer science by exploring various
                facets of this fascinating field.
            
            🌟 My academic journey is characterised by curiosity, a desire for knowledge, a passion for learning and a commitment
                to uncovering where my true passion lies.
            
            💼 I am trying to actively engage in coursework, side projects, and internships and more, all of which are helping me
                gain a well-rounded understanding of different aspects of computer science.
            
            🚀 As I navigate this path, I am excited to connect with mentors, professors, and fellow students who can share their 
                insights and experiences. Collaboration and mentorship play a pivotal role in my journey of self-discovery.
